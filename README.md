Imgup
=====

Application used to take screenshots and directly upload to Imgur.

In my fork I have made the following changes:

* Updated the menu icon to a sharper and clearer version with an inverse image when clicked
* Changed the hot keys to easier combinations
* Added the ability to screen record with a hot key.
* Added the ability to store local copies of every picture taken. They are stored in the Application Support folder "Imgup"
